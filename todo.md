## Todo
- Add VueJS to project to start adding a client side dashboard
- Add url specific dashboard to view requests in the browser
- Store requests made in a db somewhere (redis or mongo maybe?)
- Persist URLs between sessions and allow reconnecting to existing url
- Allow sessions to be closed by client, thus removing the URL + request log
