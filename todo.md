## Todo
- Add support for reading responses from target client and sending responses back to original client
- Add url specific dashboard to view requests in the browser
- Store requests made in a db somewhere (redis or mongo maybe?)
- Persist URLs between sessions and allow reconnecting to existing url
- Allow sessions to be closed by client, thus removing the URL + request log
