	<h1>Megahook</h1>
	<p>Megahook is a utility for forwarding webhooks to your local environment.</p>

	<h4>Install</h4>
	<p>
		<a href="https://golang.org/doc/install" target="_blank">Make sure that you have go installed first.</a>
		Then run the following:
	</p>
	<code>
		go install github.com/justinbrumley/megahook
	</code>
	<p>And to connect to the server and start passing traffic around:</p>
	<code>
		megahook http://localhost:8080 my-first-hook
	</code>
	<p>
		You should be given a URL you can start using for your webhooks. If the name you chose
		is already taken, you will be given a randomly generated one.
